## Voc — Foreign Words Learning App

### One‑liner
Find unknown words in your own content, then train them efficiently.

### Goals
- **Primary**: Detect words the user likely doesn’t know yet from uploaded files.
- **Secondary**: Help the user learn unknown words via focused training.

### Users and Value
- Target users: Learners reading or watching content in a foreign language who want to grow vocabulary from their own materials.
- Core value: Turn the user’s content into a personalized vocabulary list and daily practice.

### Core Experience (MVP)
- Upload content: User uploads a text/subtitle file and immediately sees a wizard to review words.
- Wizard: Words are shown in chunks; user marks known words; the rest are added to their vocabulary with context.
- Vocabulary: A list of unknown words with simple filters (by collection, alphabetical, unknown threshold).
- Practice: Two practice modes.
  - Practice #1 (multiple choice): Pick the correct answer for the prompt.
  - Practice #2 (typed or letter tiles): Type or assemble the correct word.
- Progress: After a session, user sees a summary (total answered, correct, time). Streak is visible in the header.

### Content and Collections
- Collections: Each upload becomes (or joins) a named collection so users can organize learning by source or topic.
- Context: Each word can show a short sentence from the user’s content to aid memory.

### Personalization
- Known words: Once a word is marked known, it won’t reappear in future wizard chunks.
- Practice size: Default daily practice size (e.g., 10 items) with a simple setting.


### Success Criteria (MVP)
- The user can: sign in, upload content, triage unknown words, practice them, and see session summaries.
- The app feels: fast, simple, and focused on learning words from the user’s own content.
